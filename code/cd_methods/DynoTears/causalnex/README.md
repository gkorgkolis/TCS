This directory contains selected modules of the **CausalNex** library, specifically the `structure` submodule (`notears.py`, `dynotears.py`, `structure_model.py`, `transformers.py` and `categorical_variable_mapper.py`) from version **0.12.1**.

We use this local copy instead of installing the official CausalNex package via pip because of **conflicts with `timesfm` and other dependencies**.

By copying only the required files, we maintain compatibility with our codebase while avoiding package version issues.

No changes were made to the source code and the original license (Apache 2.0) applies.
